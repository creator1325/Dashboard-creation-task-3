# Dashbord-creation-task-3

📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to create an interactive data dashboard using Tableau.  
It is designed to provide a step-by-step understanding of the process, from selecting the subject to creating visualizations and presenting results.



 🎯 Subject
The subject of the dashboard can vary depending on the dataset used. Examples:
- **Sales Performance Dashboard** – Track monthly sales, regional performance, and top products.
- **HR Analytics Dashboard** – Monitor employee count, attrition rate, and department-wise distribution.
- **Finance Dashboard** – Display revenue, expenses, and profit trends.



 🛠 Process – How the Dashboard is Created

Step 1: Identify the Objective
- Define the key questions you want the dashboard to answer.
- Example: “Which product generates the most profit?” or “What’s the trend in yearly revenue?”

Step 2: Prepare the Data
- Collect relevant datasets (Excel, CSV, database, etc.).
- Clean and format the data (remove duplicates, correct errors, standardize formats).

 Step 3: Connect to Data in Tableau
1. Open Tableau Desktop.
2. Click **Connect to Data**.
3. Choose your data source (Excel, SQL, etc.).
4. Import the dataset into Tableau.

 Step 4: Build Individual Visualizations
- Create separate sheets for each metric or KPI.
- Use different chart types based on the data:
  - **Bar Chart** for comparisons
  - **Line Chart** for trends
  - **Pie Chart** for proportions
  - **Maps** for geographic analysis

 Step 5: Combine Visualizations into a Dashboard
1. Go to New Dashboard
2. Drag and drop relevant sheets into the dashboard area.
3. Arrange them in a logical order.
4. Add filters and parameters for interactivity.
5. Format titles, colors, and tooltips for better clarity.

 Step 6: Test and Refine
- Check if filters work correctly.
- Ensure that charts are easy to read.
- Remove any unnecessary elements.

 Step 7: Publish and Share
- Save the workbook (`.twb` or `.twbx`).
- Share via Tableau Public, Tableau Server, or export as PDF/image.



 📈 Result
The final output is an **interactive dashboard** that:
- Consolidates multiple KPIs in one place.
- Allows users to filter, drill down, and explore data.
- Presents data in a clear, visually appealing way for decision-making.
